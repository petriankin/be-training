JDBC
----

JDBC is a Java API to work with databases. As any other Java specification, JDBC provides a number of interfaces and
rules that every implementation must follow. Working with JDBC looks like this:

- You work with JDBC interfaces and classes that ship with any Java installation. Examples: Connection, Statement, 
ResultSet.
- You add an implementation lib which is called a JDBC Driver (could be mysql, oracle, postgre or any other driver) and
you tell to JDBC that you want to use that implementation. 
- JDBC loads the classes from that driver and while you continue working with Connection, Statement, ResultSet 
interfaces you actually work with the implementations from the driver you chose.

JDBC and databases is one of the most critical and complicated parts of the enterprise apps. There are technologies
built on top of JDBC (ORMs like Hibernate, simpler wrappers like SpringJDBC and MyBatis) but there is no way you can 
understand and use them effectively without understanding JDBC first.

# NoSQL Storage

JDBC is used to access RDBMS's (relational databases) that utilize tables, columns, rows. But there is another group 
of databases - NoSQL DBs. These include:
- Document-oriented DBs that can store unstructured hierarchical data 
- Graph-oriented DBs that can store relations between lots of interconnected objects. 
- ... 

For several years (somewhere around 2012-2015) there was a lot of hubbub around NoSQL storage but eventually it all 
calmed down. Today most companies utilize both traditional RDBMS and NoSQL. So JDBC continues to play a major role in 
most of the modern apps.

# Step 1 - Preparations before working with DB

- Read about DAO (Data Access Object) concept. Create a DAO called InMemoryDogDao.
- Add same static collections defined in your Controllers layer to DAO and create all necessary CRUD (create, 
read, update, delete) methods there
- Use Spring IoC to inject DAO into Controller
- Change the Controller to use DAO instead of its own internal collection and remove the old collection. Make sure that
no tests are failing.

*Tip*: You've probably heard a term "Design Pattern" - this is a broad technique/approach to implement some particular
behaviour. Each of these techniques has to have a name. It simplifies and standardizes the communication as we don't 
need to explain the concept over and over again - we just tell our colleagues "Hey, let's create a DAO for this" and 
they already know what we're talking about. DAO is one of the examples. The problem is - there are many classifications 
and author of Design Patterns:
- Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns - are classical patterns that are known and used in every programming environment
be it Java, .Net or Python. Examples: MVC, Singleton, Listener, Proxy.
- Fowler's Enterprise Application Patterns (EAP) - these include more of architecture-level patterns. Examples are: 
Transaction Script, Value Object, Repository, Active Record.
- Java EE Patterns - a set of design patterns Sun Microsystems came up with when they owned Java. Include terms 
like DAO, Value Object, DTO.
- Domain Driven Design (DDD) Patterns - came from the book "Domain Driven Design" written by Eric Evans. These include
Service, Repository, etc.
- Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) - those include techniques of building software that communicates with other
applications via MOMs (Messaging Oriented Middleware that leverages async communication). These are not relevant to
the current course as we use synchronous RESTful API.
- ...

Note, that some of the names (Value Object, Repository) are repeated in different classifications. Authors made their
best to come up with the terms that make sense. Unfortunately for different people terms still meant different
things. So while the names are the same they most often mean different things. The DAO class that we just implemented
can also bear names like DAL (Data Access Layer) and DDD's Repository.

*Tip*: Note how we changed our implementation step-by-step - first creating an alternative implementation and then
migrating the code to that implementation. This is how proper refactoring works. During refactoring there should be no
point in time when application doesn't work. E.g. instead of _moving_ the collection from the Controller to DAO we first
copied it and then slowly migrated to DAO. This kind of proper refactoring is described in Fowler's 
[Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) book. These are complicated techniques as they often
require extra small steps which programmers don't like to do. But this is how professionals work - it's very (!)
important to ensure that the app always works and that you can interrupt your refactoring in favour of high priority
tasks without breaking anything.

*Tip*: Note how tests ensure that we refactor without breaking anything. Having a solid set of tests gives us courage
to do refactoring - without them it's very dangerous. This is partially how Test Driven Development (TDD) works - 
you implement a quick dirty code which is well tested, and then you improve it. Tests make sure you don't break it
while improving. To dig deeper read [Test Driven Development](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530)

# Step 2 - Basic JDBC

- Add H2 JDBC Driver as a compile-time dependency - for the sake of this course we'll be using an in-memory DB
- Create a `JdbcDogDao` - this is going to store DB-related logic for your Dogs.
- Create an instance of `DataSource` in the constructor, run DDL statements to create `DOG` table with the columns to
fit all your Dog-related data.
- Implement all the CRUD methods that insert, update, select and delete your dogs. In every method use `Statement` class
to execute SQL.
- Migrate `DataSource` creation to Spring's XML context and just inject it into your `JdbcDogDao` constructor
- Make it possible in your Controller to switch between InMemory and JDBC DAOs (think about interfaces). 
- Try switching to `JdbcDogDao` and run all the tests to ensure that the app still works.

*Think & research*: Constructor or Setter injection? Spring IoC allows you to inject dependencies both in constructors 
and in `setXxx(xxx)` methods. So why did we chose to inject DataSource into DAO constructor?

# Step 3 - PreparedStatement

- Write tests for `JdbcDogDao`. Include tests that:
   - Check the constraints - use max possible values (e.g. name with 100 symbols) and try saving them. This will ensure
   that your DB constraints can fit all the possible values.
   - Check for SQL Injections. E.g. store a dog with name `"' blah`. Every string property or method that accepts a
   string needs be tested for this attack. If you implemented _Step 2_ as it stated your tests should fail. This means
   that the app is currently vulnerable to one of the most dangerous and primitive attacks existing.
- Read about `PreparedStatement`. Change methods that pass data to SQL to use `PreparedStatement` instead of `Statement`
- Explain how `PreparedStatement` works under the hood ([this article](http://articles.javatalks.ru/articles/34) may help)
- Think and research: in which situations can `PreparedStatement` improve performance comparing to `Statement`. 
In which situations it can worsen the performance?
- Install Wireshark and one of the standalone DBs (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle XE, etc). Point the code to that DB
instead of H2 and look at the communication between JDBC and DB to figure out what information is sent by
PreparedStatements

# Step 4 - DB Migrations

In real life we don't put DDL statements in DAO (it's in your constructor at the moment). We use specialized libs
that load them and execute one by one. Such libs are Flyway and Liquibase. 

- Add Flyway as a compile time dependency
- Add an SQL migration that's currently in your DAO
- Instruct Flyway to apply the migrations during application & test startup, remove the DDL from the constructor.
Make sure that tests are still passing.
- Think and research: what if we need to update `DOG` table - are we going to modify the same migration or have 2 
migrations - one that creates the initial structure and the one that modifies it? What are the pros and cons of each
approach? Which one can be used in real life?
- Think and research. Here is a situation:
   - We wrote a migration that changes a column name
   - A new version of the software is released (and the migration is applied)
   - We found a critical bug in the software and want to roll it back to the previous version
   - When we roll back it appears that our old code doesn't recognize the new name of the column. It expects the old 
   column.
   - Question: How can we change the column name to support rollback?

# Step 5 - Basic Transactions

- Read about Transactions, understand each letter of ACID, read about Transaction Isolation Levels, record and table
locking.
- Start, commit and rollback transactions where needed in your DAO methods. In our small dog app proper transaction
management is not as crucial because every operation is atomic already. But we pretend as if we were working
with lots of SQL statements in every method.
- Make sure you utilize `try-catch-finally` to close the connections and rollback transactions in case of errors

Questions ([answers](articles/jdbc-answer-basic-tx.md)):

- If 2 TXs are started and they read the same row, will they block each other?
- If 1st TX reads and 2nd TX modifies (UPDATE or DELETE) that record, will they block each other?
- What if both TX write (UPDATE or DELETE)?
- How long will a transaction wait for rows to be unlocked if such situation occurs?
- How can you achieve dead locks? Try reproducing your expectations.
- What can you do to mitigate the risks of deadlocks?
