How do network protocols are built on top of other protocols?
----

Each networking protocol has its headers and a payload (body). Headers are needed for the correct routing while 
payload is the actual data. So payloads can have any byte sequence from the protocol perspective. And this is 
how higher-layer protocols are built - their own header and body are stored in the payload of the lower-layer
protocols. It's like russian dolls:

```
 ----------------IP Layer------------------------------------------------------
|IP Headers: source IP, destination IP, etc.                                   |
|                                                                              |
|IP Payload:   --------------TCP Layer-----------------------------------------|
|             |TCP Headers: source port, destination port                      |
|             |                                                                |
|             |TCP Payload:  ---------HTTP Layer-------------------------------|
|             |             |HTTP Headers: request line (Method, URI, Version),| 
|             |             |              headers (Host, Content-Type, etc)   |
|             |             |                                                  |
|             |             |HTTP Payload: HTML, JSON, CSS, etc.               |
|             |             |                                                  |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
Note, though that HTTP request usually doesn't fit 1 TCP packet and therefore is split in many.

The whole routing looks like this:

* IP protocol identifies the physical machine where our software runs
* TCP determines which port to use on that machine. There might be multiple software packages listening 
on different ports.
* HTTP determines which endpoint to invoke depending on its URI
